This is my homework updated 12/13/2020. The final project had objectives and problems that were hard to overcome, but learned a lot in the process. After a great number of trial and error, the code was finally done - hopefully in its entirety. Due to not being able to get graded on ZyBooks, I hope I have all the required outputs and requirements. It was definitely a different way to test the code. The project was done at different points in time so comment blocks might be inconsistent.
