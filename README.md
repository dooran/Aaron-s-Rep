This is my homework updated 12/1/2020. Homework 4 had preset templates to help out with code, however, I still had issues with the last exercise. Sometimes ZyBooks is inconsistent with issues, therefore, it is hard to fix the issue, but I know the code is good enough to understand. Each homework section was done at different points in time so comment blocks might be inconsistent.
